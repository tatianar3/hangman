 * Title: Challenge #5 - Hangman
 * Semester: COP2210 - Spring 2022
 * Professor's Name: Prof. Charters
 *
 * Description of Programâ€™s Functionality: This program demonstrates the use of a driver and domain class,
 * do-while loops, setters, getters, objects, constructors, and more. The main logic of the program is to let the
 * user make guesses with letters to try and guess the full word. The program gives the user a set amount of chances
 * to guess the correct answer, just like a true game of hangman.
